/*         Class															Object
 * 	CLass is a collection of similar objects						Object is an instance of a class
 *  Class is conceptual(is a template)								Object is real
 * 	No memory is allocated for a class								Each object has its own memory
 * 	Class can exist without any objects								Objects can not exist without a class
 * 	Class does not have any values associated with the fields		Every object has its own values associated with the fields

 * 				Garbage Collection(important subject for interview)
 * 
 * 
 * How can an object to unreferenced?
 * 1) by nulling the reference
 * 			Dog d=new Dog();
 *			d=null;
 * 
 * 2)by assigning a reference to another
 * 			Dog d1=new Dog();
 * 			Dog d2=new Dog();
 * 			d1=d2;(now the first object referred by d1 is available for garbage collection)
 * 
 * 				Using Classes from java Library
 * Library Classes: are the predefined classes provided by java system present in packages.
 * 		These classes contain related library functions like String,Match,etc.
 * Library Methods: are the inbuilt methods present in java library classes, 
 * 		provided by java system to help programmers to perform their task in easier way.
 * Package: are collection of classes or subclasses.
 * 		We have different packages defined to import the classes required in java program.
